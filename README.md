# Multi-language-Chatbots-Using-Transformers-mBERT-XLM-R-
This project demonstrates a *Multilingual Chatbot* capable of understanding user input in multiple languages (English, Spanish, French) and responding with context-aware answers. The project addresses the challenge of global customer engagement by using transformer models (mBERT/XLM-R) when available, or rule-based intent detection as a fallback.
